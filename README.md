# TMDb Movie Analysis

This repository contains my second project submission for the Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree course. The purpose of this project is to evaluate what properties have an effect on movie revenues. I used the tmdb-movies dataset provided by Udacity for this project.

## Research Question

'What kinds of properties are associated with movies that have high revenues?'

For the sake of this analysis, I focused on the following properties:

* Does the average rating score that a film has obtained on TMDb have an effect on Revenue?
* Does the movie runtime have an effect on the revenue that a movie has earned?
* Does the release year of a movie have an effect on the amount of revenue a movie has earned?
* Does the adjusted budget of a film have an effect on the revenue that a movie has earned?

## Viewing the analysis

You can view the analysis by either looking at the Jupyter Notebook file or the html file.

## Libraries

In this project, I used the following libraries

* Pandas
* Numpy
* Matplotlib.pyplot
